#+title: Under Development

Under Development is my Emacs config that is constantly changing based on my needs. It is not my proper Emacs config and it is not what I use on a daily basis for work.

The following is a checklist of what I need for my Emacs config:

- [ ] Fuzzy Search
- [ ] LSP
- [ ] Tree-sitter
- [ ] Theme
- [ ] Magit
- [ ] Plugin Manager
- [ ] Org Mode Plugins
  - [ ] org-toc
  - [ ] org-bullets
  - [ ] org-roam
